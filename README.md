# Backup Tool Base
Backup Tool Base is a simple tool that I got the idea from my assisting of klipper-backup but just base functionality of add credentials, choose files to backup and schedule that backup. It is a script for manual or automated GitHub backups for my personal use but could come in handy or be modified by others.
